# Security Awareness Plan (SAP) for Public Agencies

## Overview

This Security Awareness Plan (SAP) was developed as part of the SSAP certification program and is designed specifically for local government entities. However, it can easily be adapted to suit the needs of any public services or public works agency. The SAP is aimed at improving security culture, educating employees, and reducing human-related cybersecurity risks.

## Purpose

The purpose of this SAP is to provide a structured framework for:
- Raising security awareness among employees.
- Reducing vulnerabilities associated with human error, such as phishing, password reuse, and weak passwords.
- Implementing effective security behaviors that safeguard critical infrastructure.
- Monitoring and tracking progress through measurable learning objectives and metrics.

## Key Features

- **Customizable Learning Objectives**: Tailored objectives for educating staff on key security risks, including password management, phishing, and incident response.
- **Metrics for Tracking Progress**: A set of measurable impact metrics designed to evaluate the program's effectiveness over time.
- **Adaptable for Various Entities**: While developed for a government entity, this SAP can be customized for other organizations within the public sector.

## Contents

The SAP includes the following sections:
- **Engagement and Training Strategy**: Outlines the approach to educating and engaging employees, addressing risks specific to public entities.
